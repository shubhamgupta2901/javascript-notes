* Scoping answers the question, "Where can we access a certain variable?"
* In javascript, each function creates a scope. It is a space in which all the variables it defines are accessible. In other languages if-else/loop blocks could also create a scope. But NOT in javascript.Only functions can create scope.
* **Lexical Scoping**: A function that is lexically within another function, gets access to the scope of the outer/parent function.
