### ```this``` keyword

* ```this``` keyword refers to an object, that object which is executing current bit of javascript code.
* ```this``` is a variable that every execution context gets, and is stored inside the execution context object.
* **Regular function:** In a regular function, the ```this``` keyword points to the global object(in browser, the window object).
* **Method Call** *(When a function is a property of an object, we refer to it as method)* : the ```this``` variable points to the object that runs the method.
* NOTE: * The ```this``` keyword is not assigned a value until a function where it is defined is actually called.*

#### ```this``` in practice

Let us simply log the value of ```this```:

```javascript
console.log(this);
```
OUTPUT
```
Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}
```
* This means the ```this``` keyword in the global execution context is a ```Window``` object. This makes sense because in browsers, the default object is the ```Window``` object.

Let us call it from inside a function call 

```
function calculateAge(year){
	console.log(2019-year);
	console.log(this);
}
calculateAge(1993);
```
OUTPUT
```
26
Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}
```

* This also makes sense because we logged the value of this inside a regular function call. This function is called by the default object, hence the value of ```this``` is ```Window```.


Let us call ```this``` from inside a method call:

```javascript
var john = {
	name: "John",
	yearOfBirth: 1993,
	calculateAge: function(){
		console.log(this);
	}
}

john.calculateAge();
```
OUTPUT:
```
{name: "John", yearOfBirth: 1993, calculateAge: ƒ}
calculateAge: ƒ ()
name: "John"
yearOfBirth: 1993
__proto__: Object
```

* Calling ```this``` from inside a method will give us the object which is calling the current method, in this case the ```john``` object.
* That is why when we access the value of variables from inside the methods(functions which are properties of an object), we can use ```this``` to refer the properties of current object. Something like this:

```javascript
var john = {
	name: "John",
	yearOfBirth: 1993,
	calculateAge: function(){
		console.log(2019 - this.yearOfBirth);
	}
}

john.calculateAge();
```

OUTPUT: 
```javacript
26
```

#### Counter-intuitive JS (No idea why this works like this!)

* In the above example of ```john``` object, let us write a function inside its property ```calculateAge()``` and call it from there:

```javascript
var john = {
	name: "John",
	yearOfBirth: 1993,
	calculateAge: function(){
		console.log(this);
		console.log(2019 - this.yearOfBirth);
		function innerFunction(){
			console.log(this);
		}
		innerFunction();
	}
}

john.calculateAge();
```

```javascript
{name: "John", yearOfBirth: 1993, calculateAge: ƒ}
26
Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}
```

* The first line of output is the ```john``` object which is printed because we logged the value of ```this``` from inside the property ```calculateAge```. The second line of output is the age returned by the expression ```2019 - this.yearOfBirth```.This also makes sense because the value of ```this``` inside the method ```calculateAge``` is ```john```.

* But something counter-intutive in javascript is the value of ```this``` printed by ```innerFunction()``` which is a regular function call inside the method ```calculateAge()``` (where the value of ```this``` is ```john```) is default global object ```Window```. 

* So no matter where the function is written, if it is a regular function call, the value of ```this``` seems to be default object.
