### ```this``` keyword

* ```this``` keyword refers to an object, that object which is executing current bit of javascript code.
* ```this``` is a variable that every execution context gets, and is stored inside the execution context object.
* **Regular function:** In a regular function, the ```this``` keyword points to the global object(in browser, the window object).
* **Method Call** *(When a function is a property of an object, we refer to it as method)* : the ```this``` variable points to the object that runs the method.
* NOTE: * The ```this``` keyword is not assigned a value until a function where it is defined is actually called.*

#### ```this``` in practice

Let us simply log the value of ```this```:

```javascript
console.log(this);
```
OUTPUT
```
Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}
```
* This means the ```this``` keyword in the global execution context is a ```Window``` object. This makes sense because in browsers, the default object is the ```Window``` object.

Let us call it from inside a function call 

```
function calculateAge(year){
	console.log(2019-year);
	console.log(this);
}
calculateAge(1993);
```
OUTPUT
```
26
Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}
```

* This also makes sense because we logged the value of this inside a regular function call. This function is called by the default object, hence the value of ```this``` is ```Window```.


Let us call ```this``` from inside a method call:

```javascript
var john = {
	name: "John",
	yearOfBirth: 1993,
	calculateAge: function(){
		console.log(this);
	}
}

john.calculateAge();
```
OUTPUT:
```
{name: "John", yearOfBirth: 1993, calculateAge: ƒ}
calculateAge: ƒ ()
name: "John"
yearOfBirth: 1993
__proto__: Object
```

* Calling ```this``` from inside a method will give us the object which is calling the current method, in this case the ```john``` object.
* That is why when we access the value of variables from inside the methods(functions which are properties of an object), we can use ```this``` to refer the properties of current object. Something like this:

```javascript
var john = {
	name: "John",
	yearOfBirth: 1993,
	calculateAge: function(){
		console.log(this);
		console.log(2019 - this.yearOfBirth);
	}
}

john.calculateAge();
```

OUTPUT: 
```javacript
{name: "John", yearOfBirth: 1993, calculateAge: ƒ}
26
```

* Let us create another object ```mike```
```javascript
var mike = {
	name: "Mike",
	yearOfBirth:1984
}
```

* Suppose we want to calculate the age of ```mike```. One thing which we could do is copy the method ```calculateAge``` from ```john``` object and copy to ```mike``` object.
* Or we could do something like which is known as **method-borrowing**, and borrow the method from ```john``` object, and then call it:

```javascript
mike.calculateAge = john.calculateAge;
mike.calculateAge()
```

OUPTUT:
```javascript
{name: "Mike", yearOfBirth: 1984, calculateAge: ƒ}
35
```
* The output makes sense because, when there is a method call, the value of ```this``` inside the method is the object which is calling the method, in this case ```mike``` object. 
* This also means that ```this``` variable is only assigned a value when the object calls the method.

#### Counter-intuitive JS (No idea why this works like this!)

* In the above example of ```john``` object, let us write a function inside its property ```calculateAge()``` and call it from there:

```javascript
var john = {
	name: "John",
	yearOfBirth: 1993,
	calculateAge: function(){
		console.log(this);
		console.log(2019 - this.yearOfBirth);
		function innerFunction(){
			console.log(this);
		}
		innerFunction();
	}
}

john.calculateAge();
```

```javascript
{name: "John", yearOfBirth: 1993, calculateAge: ƒ}
26
Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}
```

* The first line of output is the ```john``` object which is printed because we logged the value of ```this``` from inside the property ```calculateAge```. The second line of output is the age returned by the expression ```2019 - this.yearOfBirth```.This also makes sense because the value of ```this``` inside the method ```calculateAge``` is ```john```.

* But something counter-intutive in javascript is the value of ```this``` printed by ```innerFunction()``` which is a regular function call inside the method ```calculateAge()``` (where the value of ```this``` is ```john```) is default global object ```Window```. 

* So no matter where the function is written, if it is a regular function call, the value of ```this``` seems to be default object.



#### More points to ponder

* To understand ```this```, we only need to know how, when and from where the function is called, it does not matter how and where function is declared or defined.
* If we are in strict mode then the default value of ```this``` is ```undefined``` otherwise ```this``` act as global object, it’s called default binding of this keyword. (default is window object in case of browser).
* when there is an object property which we are calling as a method then that object becomes ```this``` object or execution context object for that method, it is **implicit binding** of ```this``` keyword.

Example: 

```javascript
var name = "Ninja";
function bike() {
  console.log(this.name);
}
var obj1 = { name: "Pulsar", bike: bike };
var obj2 = { name: "Gixxer", bike: bike };

bike();           // "Ninja"
obj1.bike();      // "Pulsar"
obj2.bike();      // "Gixxer"
```
OUPTUT
```javascript
Ninja 
Pulsar
Gixxer
```
* Calling ```bike()``` prints ```Ninja``` because a normal function call does not have a specified execution context and hence ```this``` refers to the default object.

AND

```javascript
var name = "Ninja";
var obj1 = {
  name: "Pulsar",
  bike: function() {
    console.log(this.name);
  }
}
var obj2 = { name: "Gixxer", bike: obj1.bike };
var bike = obj1.bike;

bike();           // "Ninja"
obj1.bike();      // "Pulsar"
obj2.bike();      // "Gixxer"
```

OUPTUT
```javascript
Ninja 
Pulsar
Gixxer
```

* We can explicitly bind execution context to a method. If we use *```call```* and *```apply```* methods with a calling function, both of these methods take as their first parameter as execution context, i.e. ```this``` binding. This is called **explicit binding** of ```this``` or execution context.

```javascript
var name = "Ninja";

function bike() {
  console.log(this.name);
}
var obj = { name: "Pulsar" }

bike();           // "Ninja"
bike.call(obj);   // "Pulsar"
```

OUTPUT:
```javascript
Ninja
Pulsar
```

* In **Fixed Binding** we can force the ```this``` object to be same always no matter from where and how it gets called.

```javascript
var name = "Ninja";
var bike = function() {
  console.log(this.name);
}
var obj1 = { name: "Pulsar" };
var obj2 = { name: "Gixxer" };

var originalBikeFun = bike;
bike = function() {
  originalBikeFun.call(obj1);
};

bike();           // "Pulsar"
bike.call(obj2);  // "Pulsar"
```
