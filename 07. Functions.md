### Functions
* Function is an **object**. 
  * We can store functions in a variable.
  * We can pass functions as arguments to other functions.
  * We can also return a function from another function.
  
#### Passing Functions as argument
* For example when trying to calculate the age of each person in an array, we can do something like this: 
```javascript
var years = [1990,1965, 1937, 2005, 1998];

function calculateAge(dob){
	return 2019-dob;
}

function arrayCalc(array, calculateAge){
	var resArray = [];
	for (var i = 0; i<array.length; i++){
		resArray.push(calculateAge(array[i]));
	}
	return resArray;
}

console.log(arrayCalc(years,calculateAge)); 
```

OUTPUT
```
(5)Â [29, 54, 82, 14, 21]
```

* Note that in  ```console.log()``` statement, we have passed ```calculateAge``` as parameter and **NOT** ```calculateAge()``` ,to function ```arrayCalc()```. This is because we only want to pass the reference of the object which contains the actual function ```calculateAge```. By passing ```calculateAge()``` we are essentially invoking the ```calculateAge``` function at place, which we do not want. We want to pass the reference of function, and then the ```arrayCalc``` function can call it whenever it wants.

* These functions are called **callback functions** because these are functions that we pass to another function, that will call them later.

#### Functions returning functions

```javascript
function interviewQuestion(job){
	switch (job) {
		case "designer":
			return function (name){
				console.log(name+", can you explain what ux design is?");
			}
		case "teacher":
			return function (name){
				console.log("What subject do you teach, " + name);
			}
		default:
			return function(name){
				console.log("Hello "+ name + " . What do you do?");
			}
	}
}

var teacherQuestion = interviewQuestion("teacher");
teacherQuestion("John");

var designerQuestion = interviewQuestion("designer");
designerQuestion("Shubham");

interviewQuestion("designer")("Shubham");
```

OUTPUT:

```
What subject do you teach, John
script_functions.js:26 Shubham, can you explain what ux design is?
script_functions.js:26 Shubham, can you explain what ux design is?
```

#### Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IFEE)

* 

```javascript
function game(){
	var rand = Math.random()*10;
	console.log(rand>=5);
}
game();

(function (){
	var rand = Math.random()*10;
	console.log(rand>=5);
})();


(function(goodLuckFactor){
	var rand = Math.random()*10;
	console.log(rand>=(5-goodLuckFactor));
})(1);
```

* If we write the function, without enclosing them in parantheses, JS parser would think this is a function declaration, but since it doesn't also have a name it would throw an error.

* By adding parantheses we trick the parser into thinking that whatever is inside the parantheses is not a declaration but an expression, because in JS what's inside a parantheses cannot be a statement.And like this it treats the anonymous function inside the parantheses as an expression.

* And then after that, we only have to invoke the function,because, if we didn't do this,then it would never be called and never do anything,and since we don't attach this to a variable, then nothing would ever happened.
