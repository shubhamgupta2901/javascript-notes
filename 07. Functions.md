### Functions
* Function is an **object**. 
  * We can store functions in a variable.
  * We can pass functions as arguments to other functions.
  * We can also return a function from another function.
  
#### Passing Functions as argument
* For example when trying to calculate the age of each person in an array, we can do something like this: 
```javascript
var years = [1990,1965, 1937, 2005, 1998];

function calculateAge(dob){
	return 2019-dob;
}

function arrayCalc(array, calculateAge){
	var resArray = [];
	for (var i = 0; i<array.length; i++){
		resArray.push(calculateAge(array[i]));
	}
	return resArray;
}

console.log(arrayCalc(years,calculateAge)); 
```

OUTPUT
```
(5)Â [29, 54, 82, 14, 21]
```

* Note that in  ```console.log()``` statement, we have passed ```calculateAge``` as parameter and **NOT** ```calculateAge()``` ,to function ```arrayCalc()```. This is because we only want to pass the reference of the object which contains the actual function ```calculateAge```. By passing ```calculateAge()``` we are essentially invoking the ```calculateAge``` function at place, which we do not want. We want to pass the reference of function, and then the ```arrayCalc``` function can call it whenever it wants.

* These functions are called **callback functions** because these are functions that we pass to another function, that will call them later.

#### Functions returning functions

```javascript
function interviewQuestion(job){
	switch (job) {
		case "designer":
			return function (name){
				console.log(name+", can you explain what ux design is?");
			}
		case "teacher":
			return function (name){
				console.log("What subject do you teach, " + name);
			}
		default:
			return function(name){
				console.log("Hello "+ name + " . What do you do?");
			}
	}
}

var teacherQuestion = interviewQuestion("teacher");
teacherQuestion("John");

var designerQuestion = interviewQuestion("designer");
designerQuestion("Shubham");

interviewQuestion("designer")("Shubham");
```

OUTPUT:

```
What subject do you teach, John
script_functions.js:26 Shubham, can you explain what ux design is?
script_functions.js:26 Shubham, can you explain what ux design is?
```
