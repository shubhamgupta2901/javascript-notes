### Functions
* Function is an **object**. 
  * We can store functions in a variable.
  * We can pass functions as arguments to other functions.
  * We can also return a function from another function.
  
#### Passing Functions as argument
* For example when trying to calculate the age of each person in an array, we can do something like this: 
```javascript
var years = [1990,1965, 1937, 2005, 1998];

function calculateAge(dob){
	return 2019-dob;
}

function arrayCalc(array, calculateAge){
	var resArray = [];
	for (var i = 0; i<array.length; i++){
		resArray.push(calculateAge(array[i]));
	}
	return resArray;
}

console.log(arrayCalc(years,calculateAge)); 
```

OUTPUT
```
(5)Â [29, 54, 82, 14, 21]
```

* Note that in  ```console.log()``` statement, we have passed ```calculateAge``` as parameter and **NOT** ```calculateAge()``` ,to function ```arrayCalc()```. This is because we only want to pass the reference of the object which contains the actual function ```calculateAge```. By passing ```calculateAge()``` we are essentially invoking the ```calculateAge``` function at place, which we do not want. We want to pass the reference of function, and then the ```arrayCalc``` function can call it whenever it wants.

* These functions are called **callback functions** because these are functions that we pass to another function, that will call them later.

#### Functions returning functions

```javascript
function interviewQuestion(job){
	switch (job) {
		case "designer":
			return function (name){
				console.log(name+", can you explain what ux design is?");
			}
		case "teacher":
			return function (name){
				console.log("What subject do you teach, " + name);
			}
		default:
			return function(name){
				console.log("Hello "+ name + " . What do you do?");
			}
	}
}

var teacherQuestion = interviewQuestion("teacher");
teacherQuestion("John");

var designerQuestion = interviewQuestion("designer");
designerQuestion("Shubham");

interviewQuestion("designer")("Shubham");
```

OUTPUT:

```
What subject do you teach, John
script_functions.js:26 Shubham, can you explain what ux design is?
script_functions.js:26 Shubham, can you explain what ux design is?
```

#### Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IFEE)

* 

```javascript
function game(){
	var rand = Math.random()*10;
	console.log(rand>=5);
}
game();

(function (){
	var rand = Math.random()*10;
	console.log(rand>=5);
})();


(function(goodLuckFactor){
	var rand = Math.random()*10;
	console.log(rand>=(5-goodLuckFactor));
})(1);
```

* If we write the function, without enclosing them in parantheses, JS parser would think this is a function declaration, but since it doesn't also have a name it would throw an error.

* By adding parantheses we trick the parser into thinking that whatever is inside the parantheses is not a declaration but an expression, because in JS what's inside a parantheses cannot be a statement.And like this it treats the anonymous function inside the parantheses as an expression.

* And then after that, we only have to invoke the function,because, if we didn't do this,then it would never be called and never do anything,and since we don't attach this to a variable, then nothing would ever happened.


#### Closures

* An inner function has always access to the variables of its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.This is called **closure**.

* For example:
```javascript
function retirement(retirementAge){
	var a = " years left until retirement";
	return function(yearOfBirth){
		var age = 2019- yearOfBirth;
		console.log((retirementAge-age)+a);
	}
}
var usRetirement = retirement(66);
usRetirement(1993);
```

OUTPUT: 
```
40 years left until retirement
```

* Here we started by calling ```retirement``` function and passed the value of 66. The function then declares ```a``` variable and returns an anonymous function. Then the function finishes, and its execution context gets popped off the stack.

* We have stored the returned function in the variable ```usRetirement```, and then we call it. Inside this function, we use the ```retirementAge``` parameter passed to the outer function ```retirement``` as well as the variable ```a```, which is also declared in the outer function.

* So we were able to use the values of ```retirement``` function, even when it had stopped execution and its execution context is gone. This is because of *closure*

* *How does it work?* : 
  * When we call the ```retirement``` function, it gets its own execution context. This execution context has an object which contains the *Variable Object, Scope chain and ```this``` variable*.
  * *Variable Object* contains the variable declarations, function declarations and function arguments of a function. And *Scope chains* are like pointers to all the Variable Objects the function has access to.
  ![](https://github.com/shubhamgupta2901/javascript-notes/blob/master/assets/closure-1.png)
  * When the function returns, the execution context of the function is effectively gone, And with it the Variable Object and Scope chain of the function ```retirement```should be gone too.But its NOT the case.
  * Even after the function returns and the execution context is gone, the Variable Object is still there, it can be accessed from memory.
  * When we call ```usRetirement``` function, since the Variable Object of ```retirement``` function is still there, the Scope Chain of the ```usRetirement``` function will have a pointer to  the Variable Object of the ```retirement``` function.  And the scope chain will remain intact.
  ![](https://github.com/shubhamgupta2901/javascript-notes/blob/master/assets/closure-2.png)
  * And so, we can access the variables that were created in the ```retirement``` function long after the function has completed execution, and after its execution context is, of course, gone. The current execution context has ***closed in*** on the outer variable object,so that it can use it, and that's why it's called a **closure**.
