* Function is an **object**. 
  * We can store functions in a variable.
  * We can pass functions as arguments to other functions.
  * We can also return a function from another function.
  
* For example when trying to calculate the age of each person in an array, we can do something like this: 
```javascript
var years = [1990,1965, 1937, 2005, 1998];

function calculateAge(dob){
	return 2019-dob;
}

function arrayCalc(array, calculateAge){
	var resArray = [];
	for (var i = 0; i<array.length; i++){
		resArray.push(calculateAge(array[i]));
	}
	return resArray;
}

console.log(arrayCalc(years,calculateAge)); 
```

* Note that in  ```console.log()``` statement, we have passed ```calculateAge``` as parameter and **NOT** ```calculateAge()``` ,to function ```arrayCalc()```. This is because we only want to pass the reference of the object which contains the actual function ```calculateAge```. By passing ```calculateAge()``` we are essentially invoking the ```calculateAge``` function at place, which we do not want. We want to pass the reference of function, and then the ```arrayCalc``` function can call it whenever it wants.
