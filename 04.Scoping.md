* Scoping answers the question, "Where can we access a certain variable?"
* In javascript, each function creates a scope. It is a space in which all the variables it defines are accessible. In other languages if-else/loop blocks could also create a scope. But NOT in javascript.Only functions can create scope.
* **Lexical Scoping**: A function that is lexically within another function, gets access to the scope of the outer/parent function.

* In the above example.
  * we have a global scope. In this scope we have access to the variable ```a``` and also the function ```first()```. 
  * Then the a local scope of function ```first()```. It has access to the variable ```b``` and the function ```second()```.Due to lexical scoping, the scope of this function also has the access to the global scope.  
  * Finally we have local scope of function ```second()```. It has access to the variable ```c``` and due to lexical scoping, it also has access to local scope of function ```first()``` and also th global scope. 

* **Scope Chain**: If you look at the definition of function ```second()```, when running this code, the javascript engine will not find variable ```b``` in its scope, So it goes up and looks in the scope of its parent function, and finds ```b```. For variable ```a``` it will not find it in its scope, or the scope of its parent either.So it goes up to the global scope to find the variable ```a```. This is called scope chain.
* Only when the javascript engine does not find the variable anywhere in the scope chain, it throws an error and stops execution.

* Behind the scenes, when the above snippet of code is run:
  * a global execution context is created. In this execution context the Variable Object will be created. During the creation of Variable Object, it will scan through the code to find its functions and variables, it will then have the properties pointing to the variable ```a``` and function ```first()```. The scope chain of this global execution stack will have access to its Variable Object.
  * the global execution context is the active execution context currently, and then the function ```first()``` is called.
  * When ```first()``` is called, a new execution context is created, and is pushed to the execution stack. During the creation of this execution stack, a Variable Object is created. This Variable Object will have the properties pointing to variable ```b``` and function ```second()```. When the scope chain of this execution context is created, it will have access to its Variable Object as well as the Variable Object of its parent.
  * When ```second()``` is called, the Variable Object of its execution stack will have access to variable ```c```. Its scope chain will have this Variable Object as well the Variable Object of its parent function ```first()``` as well as the Variable Object of global execution context.
  
  **Execution Context vs Scope Chain**

  * Remember Execution Context and Scope Chain are two seperate things.Execution stacks are created and pushed in the order the functions are called, but the scope chain for a function is created in the lexical order the functions are written in the code.
