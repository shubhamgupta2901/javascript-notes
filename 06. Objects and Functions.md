### Objects and Functions

* There are two types of data types in java script - **Primitives** & **Objects**. Everything apart from primitives is an object.

* **Primitives** : ```NUmbers, Strings, Booleans,Undefined, Null  ```. 

* **Objects**: ```Arrays, Functions, Wrapper for Numbers, Strings, Booleans etc.```

* Variables containing the *primitives* (or the value represented by these variables) actually hold the data inside the variable itself.Variables associated with *objects* do not actually contain the object,but instead they contain a reference to the place in memory where the object is stored.

Example:

```
var a = 23;
var b = a;
a = 46;
console.log(a);
console.log(b);
```
OUTPUT:
```
46
23
```
This means that each of the variable actually hold the copy of their own data.

```javascript
var obj1 = {
	name: 'John',
	age: 26,
}

var obj2 = obj1;
obj1.age = 30;

console.log(obj1.age);
console.log(obj2.age);
```
OUTPUT: 
```
30
30
```

This happens because we did not create a new object for ```obj2```. We simply passed the reference of object which ```obj1``` points to, to ```obj2```. Due to this, when the object properties are modified, it is reflected in both the variables ```obj1``` and ```obj2```.

#### Constructors
* Constructors are special methods (since functions are also objects, does it mean constructors are essentially objects?) which are used to generate objects. They are the blueprint from which we may create multiple instances.

So instead of creating objects like this:
```javascript
var john = {
	name: "John",
	yearOfBirth: 1993,
	calculateAge: function(){
		return (2019-this.yearOfBirth);
	}
}
```

We can create a constructor like this: 
```javascript
function Person(name, yearOfBirth){
	this.name = name;
	this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth;
	this.calculateAge = function (){
		return 2019 - this.yearOfBirth;
	};
}
```

And create as many objects from this blueprint as we want:

```javascript
var mike = new Person("Mike",1990);
var jason = new Person ("Jason", 1975);
```

* With functions, it works the exact same way.two examples for reference,

```javascript
var age =27;
var obj = {
	name: 'Jonas',
	city: 'Lisbon'
}

function change(a,b){
	a = 30;
	b.city = 'San francisco';
}
change(age, obj);

console.log(age);
console.log(obj.city);
```

OUTPUT:
```
30
San Francisco
```

```javascript
var age =27;
var obj = {
	name: 'Jonas',
	city: 'Lisbon'
}

function change(a,b){
	a = 30;
	b = 'San francisco';
}
change(age, obj.city);

console.log(age);
console.log(obj.city);

```
OUTPUT:
```javascript
27
Lisbon
```
#### Inheritance

* Inheritance is when one object is based on another object. Its when one object gets access to another objects properties and methods.
* Consider  we wish to have an ```Athelete``` constructor. Now an ```Athlete``` is also a ```Person```. In addition it may also have some other properties.
* So we can use Inheritance here and make the ```Athlete``` object inherit the properties and methods of ```Person``` object.
