### Objects and Functions

* There are two types of data types in java script - **Primitives** & **Objects**. Everything apart from primitives is an object.

* **Primitives** : ```NUmbers, Strings, Booleans,Undefined, Null  ```

* **Objects**: ```Arrays, Functions, Wrapper for Numbers, Strings, Booleans etc.```

#### Constructors
* Constructors are special methods (since functions are also objects, does it mean constructors are essentially objects?) which are used to generate objects. They are the blueprint from which we may create multiple instances.

So instead of creating objects like this:
```javascript
var john = {
	name: "John",
	yearOfBirth: 1993,
	calculateAge: function(){
		return (2019-this.yearOfBirth);
	}
}
```

We can create a constructor like this: 
```javascript
function Person(name, yearOfBirth){
	this.name = name;
	this.yearOfBirth = yearOfBirth;
	this.calculateAge = function (){
		return 2019 - this.yearOfBirth;
	};
}
```

And create as many objects from this blueprint as we want:

```javascript
var mike = new Person("Mike",1990);
var jason = new Person ("Jason", 1975);
```

#### Inheritance

* Inheritance is when one object is based on another object. Its when one object gets access to another objects properties and methods.
* Consider  we wish to have an ```Athelete``` constructor. Now an ```Athlete``` is also a ```Person```. In addition it may also have some other properties.
* So we can use Inheritance here and make the ```Athlete``` object inherit the properties and methods of ```Person``` object.
