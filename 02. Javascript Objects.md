### Objects

* Two types of data types in javascript: primitives ( boolean, number, string, undefined, null and symbol) and objects.
* Objectsa are user defined data types.
* Arays and functions are objects.

* If an object has variables they are known as *properties* and the functions are known as *methods*.

* **Object literal notation**: Use two curly braces and place key-value pairs within those braces.

```
var car = {
	wheels: 4,
	color: 'red',
	mpg: 34,
	engine: 1,
	gallons: 12
};

console.log(car) //{ wheels: 4, color: 'red', mpg: 34, engine: 1, gallons: 12 }

```

* **Dot notation** :
```
var car = {};
//object.property = value
car.wheels = 4;	
car.color = 'red';
car.mpg = 34;
car.engine = 1;
car.gallons = 12;

{console.log(car) // wheels: 4, color: 'red', mpg: 34, engine: 1, gallons: 12 }
```

* **Bracket Notation** : 
```
var car = {}
//object['property'] = value;

car['wheels'] = 4;
car['color'] = 'red';
car['mpg'] = 34;
car['engine'] = 1;
car['gallons'] = 12;

{console.log(car) // wheels: 4, color: 'red', mpg: 34, engine: 1, gallons: 12 }
```

### Constructors

* Special functions to initialize the objects.
