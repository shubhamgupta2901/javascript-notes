### Variables

```javascript
  var transportation = 'car';
```

* ```var``` is a keyword. ```transportation``` is a variable name. Variable names starting with a number are INVALID.```=``` is an assignment operator.


* Until a value is assigned to a variable, it is unassigned and its value is ```undefined```.

```javascript
var transporation; // undefined
var transporation = 'car'; // 'car'
```

*  Javascript is unscripted dynamic language.This means you don't have to define what the variable type is. Javascript automatically detects the type of variable by its value. This is also called Dynamic typing.

* ```typeof``` returns the type of variable.

```javascript
var transportation = 'car'
var passLieDetector = false
var groceryBill = 74
var x = {
firstName: 'Shubham'
lastName: 'Gupta'
}

typeof transportation // returns String
typeof passLieDetector //returns boolean
typeof groceryBill //returns number
typeof x // object 
```

* There are six java PRIMITIVE variable types: String,number, boolean, null, undefined and symbol. Symbol is newly included in ES6
### Strings

* Strings are a primitive datatype used to represent text. They can either be wrapped in single quote('') or double quotes("").

* **Quotes within a String** :

```javascript
var message = 'It's a beautiful day!';  //error
var response= "Billy said, "I am okay""; //error
```
One way to solve this problem is to ensure never to use a double quote when single quotes are required in the string. and vice versa. 

```javascript
var message = "It's a beautiful day!"; //error
var response= 'Billy said, "I am okay"';  //error
```
* **Special Characters** : The correct solution will be to use Escape or Backslash character (\).It turns special characters to string characters.

```javascript
var message = 'It\'s a beautiful day' //correct
```
* ** Length Property** : length is a property present in string class.

```javascript
var greeting = 'It\'s good to meet you'
greeting.length; //21
```
* **Sample String methods**: 

```
// toUpperCase() 
var greeting = 'Good to see you!';
var shoutGreeting = greeting.toUpperCase();
greeting; // 'Good to see you!'
shoutGreeting; // 'GOOD TO SEE YOU!'
```
