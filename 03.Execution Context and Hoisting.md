* All javascript code needs to run in an environment, and these environments are called execution context.
* The default execution context of a code is always global context of the class. 
* Global context of a class is for variables and functions which are not inside any other function.
* Each time we will call a function, it will get its own execution context, and all the variables inside these functions reside in their respective execution context.
* Execution context can be understood as an object.


* For example:
  * When the code is run, a global execution context is provided. All the variables and functions which are not inside any functions reside inside the global execution context of the class. ```name, first(), second(), third()```
  * At the end we have called  ```first()``` function, and it will get its own execution context now.This execution context is pushed to the execution stack. So for the duration of ```first()``` call, the active context will be the execution context of the function.
  * All the variables and functions declared inside the ```first()``` will be stored inside the execution context of ```first()```.
  * Same thing will happen when ```second()``` and ```third()``` functions, they will get their own execution context which will be pushed in the execution context.

  *  When the execution of ```third()``` function ends, its execution context is popped from the execution stack and is destroyed. The top of the exection stack will now become the active context. 
  
**Execution Context in Detail**

![alt text](https://github.com/shubhamgupta2901/javascript-notes/blob/master/assets/Execution%20Context%20in%20detail.png "")

* We can associate execution context with an object, which has three properties:
  * *Variable Object*: It contains the inner variable declarations, function declarations and function arguments.
  * *Scope Chain*: It contains the current variable object of execution context, as well as the Variable Objects of all its parents.
  * *```this``` variable*

* *How is execution context created?*
  * When a new function is called, a new execution context for this function is pushed on the execution stack.This happens in two phases: 
    1. **Creation Phase**:
      * Creation of the Variable Object
      * Creation of Scope Chain
      * Determine the value of ```this``` variable
    2. **Execution Phase**: 
      * In the execution phase, the code of the function that generated the execution context is run line by line and all the variables are defined.

**Creation Of the Variable Object**
* The argument object is created, containing all the arguments that were passed into the current function(who is the owner of current execution context)
* Code is scanned for *function declarations*, for each function, a property is created in the Variable Object, pointing to the function. This means all the variables having the reference of the functions will already be stored inside the variable object even before the code starts executing.
* Code is scanned for variable declarations, for each variable, a property is created in the Variable Object and set to ```undefined```.

* The last two steps are generally known as **hoisting**. Functions and variables are **hoisted** in java script, which means, they are available even before the execution phase starts. The only difference is the functions are already defined before the execution phase starts while variables are set to undefined and will only be defined during the exeuction phase of the function. 

**Hoisting in practice**

* Consider a simple example:

```
function calculateAge(year){
	console.log(2019-year);
}

calculateAge(1993);
```
OUTPUT
```
26
```
When we run the following code, we could see in the console that the output is ```26```. However if I put the function call before function declaration the code would still run and work perfectly fine.

```
calculateAge(1993);

function calculateAge(year){
	console.log(2019-year);
}
```
OUTPUT:
```
26
```
* This is **hoisting**. It is due to the fact that even before the execution phase of the code began, in the creation phase, an execution context for this code was created. In the execution context a Variable Object was created, which scanned the complete source code and created a property which points to the ```calculateAge()``` function. 
* So when the code was executed, even though the declaration of ```calculateAge()``` function comes after the calling statement, it is already availabe to us in the variable object.


* Let us consider another example involving a function expression:

```
var retirement = function(year){
	console.log(65-(2019-year));
}

retirement(1993);
```
OUTPUT
```
39
```

* The above code works as expected.However if I call the function before the declaration of function expression, it will not work, as it worked with a normal function declaration.

```
retirement(1993);

var retirement = function(year){
	console.log(65-(2019-year));
}
```
OUTPUT
```
Uncaught TypeError: retirement is not a function
    at script.js:9
```

* This is because how hoisting works. We have not written a normal function declaration which could be accessed from variable object even before execution begins. We actually a variable here. Before the execution phase, during the creation phase, the code is scanned and corresponding to all the variables, properties are created in the Variable Object and they are set to ```undefined```. They will be assigned value only when the execution begins. And when the execution begins, even before the value of the variable ```retirement``` could be assigned, we have tried to access it, resulting in a run time error.

* Same thing could be observed with variables,

```
var age = 28;
console.log(age);
```
OUTPUT:
```
28
```
But if we try to access it before the declaration:
```
console.log(age);
var age = 28;
```
OUTPUT:
```
undefined
```

* Another simple example to point out execution contexts:

```
var age = 23;

function foo(){
	var age = 65;
	console.log(age);
}

foo();
console.log(age);
```

OUPTUT:
```
65
23
```

* The above code works fine, and is able to make the distinction between ```age``` variables, one of which is outside and ohter one inside ```foo()```, because the global ```age``` variable lives inside the Varialbe Object of global execution context.While the variable ```age``` inside ```foo()``` lives inside the Variable Object of ```foo()```'s execution context.
