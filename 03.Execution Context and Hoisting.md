* All javascript code needs to run in an environment, and these environments are called execution context.
* The default execution context of a code is always global context of the class. 
* Global context of a class is for variables and functions which are not inside any other function.
* Each time we will call a function, it will get its own execution context, and all the variables inside these functions reside in their respective execution context.
* Execution context can be understood as an object.


* For example:
  * When the code is run, a global execution context is provided. All the variables and functions which are not inside any functions reside inside the global execution context of the class. ```name, first(), second(), third()```
  * At the end we have called  ```first()``` function, and it will get its own execution context now.This execution context is pushed to the execution stack. So for the duration of ```first()``` call, the active context will be the execution context of the function.
  * All the variables and functions declared inside the ```first()``` will be stored inside the execution context of ```first()```.
  * Same thing will happen when ```second()``` and ```third()``` functions, they will get their own execution context which will be pushed in the execution context.

  *  When the execution of ```third()``` function ends, its execution context is popped from the execution stack and is destroyed. The top of the exection stack will now become the active context. 
  
**Execution Context in Detail**

* We can associate execution context with an object, which has three properties:
  * *Variable Object*: It contains the inner variable declarations, function declarations and function arguments.
  * *Scope Chain*: It contains the current variable object of execution context, as well as the Variable Objects of all its parents.
  * *```this``` variable*

* *How is execution context created?*
  * When a new function is called, a new execution context for this function is pushed on the execution stack.This happens in two phases: 
    1. **Creation Phase**:
      * Creation of the Variable Object
      * Creation of Scope Chain
      * Determine the value of ```this``` variable
    2. **Execution Phase**: 
      * In the execution phase, the code of the function that generated the execution context is run line by line and all the variables are defined.
