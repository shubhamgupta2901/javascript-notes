### ```let``` and ```const```
* Instead of using ```var``` keyword, ES6 allows us to use ```let``` and ```const```.
* ```const``` is to be used for variables which will not change their values. There value can not be mutated.
* ```const``` variables need to be initiallized at the time of declaration. Otherwise we get ```Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration```

* ES5 Syntax:
```javascript
var nameES5 = 'Jane Smith';
var ageES5 = 23;
nameES5 = 'Jane Miller';
console.log(nameES5); //Jane Miller
```
* ES6 Syntax:
```javascript
const nameES6 = 'Jane Smith';
let ageES6 = 23;
ageES6 = 24;
console.log(ageES6); // 24
//nameES6 = 'Jane Miller'; // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

* variables declared with ```var``` in ES5 are *function-scoped*, but variables declared with ```const``` and ```let``` in ES6 are *block-scoped*.
* A block groups zero or more statements.The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets ```{}``` and may optionally be labelled.
* For example: 
ES5
```javascript
function driversLicense(passedTest){
	if(passedTest){
		var firstName = 'John';
		var yearOfBirth = 1990;

		console.log(firstName + " born in "+ yearOfBirth+ " is now officially allowed to drive car.");
	}
}
driversLicense(true);
```
OUTPUT: 
```John born in 1990 is now officially allowed to drive car.```

Also in ES5, 

```javascript
function driversLicense(passedTest){
	if(passedTest){
		var firstName = 'John';
		var yearOfBirth = 1990;
	}
	console.log(firstName + " born in "+ yearOfBirth+ " is now officially allowed to drive car.");
}
driversLicense(true);
```
OUTPUT: 
```John born in 1990 is now officially allowed to drive car.```

* Lets look at same code in ES6 using ```const``` and ```let```:

```javascript
function driversLicense(passedTest){
	if(passedTest){
		let firstName = 'John';
		const yearOfBirth = 1990;
		console.log(firstName + " born in "+ yearOfBirth+ " is now officially allowed to drive car.");
	}
}
driversLicense(true);
```
OUTPUT: 
```John born in 1990 is now officially allowed to drive car.```


```javascript
function driversLicense(passedTest){
	if(passedTest){
		let firstName = 'John';
		const yearOfBirth = 1990;
	}
	console.log(firstName + " born in "+ yearOfBirth+ " is now officially allowed to drive car.");
}
driversLicense(true);
```
OUTPUT: 
```Error: Uncaught ReferenceError: firstName is not defined```

* Another example for scoping is:
```javascript
let i = 23;
for (let i = 0; i< 5; i++){
	console.log(i);
}
console.log(i);
```
OUTPUT:
```
0
1
2
3
4
23
```

* This means assigning other values to ```i``` in the loop, doesn't change the value of ```i``` variable that we have defined before the for loop. Again this is because variables declared with ```let``` and ```const``` are block-scoped. And so the ```i``` variable inside the loop is a completeley different variable than the variable ```i``` that was defined before it.

* Where as in ES5: 

```javascript
var i = 23;
for (var i = 0; i< 5; i++){
	console.log(i);
}
console.log(i);
```
OUTPUT:
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
```

* Another difference between ES5 and ES6 is the way variables can be accessed before their declaration. 

* In ES5, when we use variables before they are declared, we get the value ```undefined```. This is because of the way, variables are hoisted during the creation of Variable Objects. Code is scanned for all the variables, and for each variable a property is created in Variable Object and set to ```undefined```.

* For example in ES5: 
```javascript
function driversLicense(passedTest){
	if(passedTest){
		console.log(firstName + " born in "+ yearOfBirth+ " is now officially allowed to drive car.");
		var firstName = 'John';
		var yearOfBirth = 1990;
	}
}
driversLicense(true);
```
OUTPUT: 
```undefined born in undefined is now officially allowed to drive car.```

* But in ES6:

```javascript
function driversLicense(passedTest){
	if(passedTest){
		console.log(firstName + " born in "+ yearOfBirth+ " is now officially allowed to drive car.");
		let firstName = 'John';
		const yearOfBirth = 1990;
	}
}
driversLicense(true);
```
OUTPUT: 
```Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'firstName' before initialization```

* IN ES6, This happens because of something called *Temporal-dead zone*, which basically just means that the variables are actually hoisted, but we still cannot access them before they are declared.
* So in ES6 we can only use a variable (if we use keyword ```const``` or ```let```) after we declare and define it.

##

### Blocks and IIFEs

* IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) help us in data privacy. They are immediately invoked and so their execution context gets popped off from the execution stack, immediately. This means the variables of these functions cannot be accessed as the scope chain is not accessible. But due to closure if the IIFE returns a function, that function can access the internal variables and functions and outside the IIFE we can acess the returned function.

* Since variables declared with keyword ```const``` and ```let``` are block scoped, it makes the syntax of IIFEs quite simple in ES6.

* Syntax for IIFEs in ES5 was:
```javascript
(function(){
	var a = 1;
	var b = 2;
})();

console.log(a + " "+ b);
```
OUTPUT
```javascript 
Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined
```
* With ES6, theres a new way to create IIFEs:

```javascript
{
	const a = 1;
	let b = 2;
}

console.log(a + " "+ b);
```
OUTPUT
```javascript 
Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined
```

* Just to note, if we use ```var``` keyword for declaring variables inside the block we would still be able to access them outside because they are function-scoped.
```javascript
{
	const a = 1;
	let b = 2;
	var c = 3
}

console.log(c);
```
OUTPUT
```javascript 
3
```
## 

### Strings
* There are big improvements on how we handle strings in ES6.

* Consider following lines of code
```javascript
let firstName = 'John';
let lastName = 'Smith';
const yearOfBirth = 1993;

function calcAge(year){
	return 2019-year;
}
```

* In ES5, if we wanted to put all the above data in a string, we needed to concatenate them with a ```+``` sign. Like this:

```javascript
console.log('This is '+ firstName + ' ' + lastName + ' and my age is '+ calcAge(yearOfBirth)+ ' years.');
```
OUTPUT:
```javascript
This is John Smith and my age is 26 years.
```

* In ES6 we have **Template Literal**. With this, we use backticks (`` ` ``) instead of quotation marks('' or ""). Rather than concatenating the variables using ```+``` sign, we use ```${}``` and put the variables inside them.

```javascript
console.log(`This is ${firstName} ${lastName} and my age is ${calcAge(yearOfBirth)} years.`);
```
OUTPUT:
```javascript
This is John Smith and my age is 26 years.
```

* Some new methods for strings:

```javascript
const n = `${firstName} ${lastName}`
console.log(n.startsWith('J'));  //case sensitive OUTPUT: true
console.log(n.includes(' '));  //case sensitive OUTPUT: true
console.log(n.endsWith('th'));  //case sensitive OUTPUT: true
console.log(firstName.repeat(5)); //JohnJohnJohnJohnJohn
console.log(`${firstName} `.repeat(5)); //John John John John John 
```
##

### Arrow Functions

* Suppose we have an array with birth years, and we want to calculate the age for each of these years:

```javascript
const years = [1990, 1965, 1982, 1937];
```
* In ES5 we can use the ```map()``` method like below,to loop over ```years``` array and return a new array with ages.

```javascript
var ages = years.map(function(year){
	return 2019-year;
});
console.log(ages);
```

OUTPUT:
```javascript
(4) [29, 54, 37, 82]
```

* In ES6 using **arrow functions**, we have a more quicker and concise way of writing methods like these, with callback functions.

```javascript
var ages = years.map((year)=> 2019-year);
console.log(ages);
```

OUTPUT:
```javascript
(4) [29, 54, 37, 82]
```

* There are three ways of writing arrow functions:
	* you put one argument and one line of code - which is the simplest form
	* If there are more than one arguments, use the parantheses ```()```
	* If we have more than one lines of code in function body, use curly braces and ```return``` keyword at the end.
	
* Remember in ```map()``` method, we have access to three different arguments: ```currentValue, currentIndex, array```. So if we need to use more than one parameters we can write this:

```javascript
var ages = years.map((year, index)=> `Age element at ${index} is ${2019-year}`);
console.log(ages);
```
OUTPUT:

```javascript
(4) ["Age element at 0 is 29", "Age element at 1 is 54", "Age element at 2 is 37", "Age element at 3 is 82"]
```

* If we have more than one line in the body of callback function, we can use the curly braces, and also the return keyword is not implicit and we have to write it again.

```javascript
var ages = years.map((element, index)=>{
	const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
	const age = currentYear - element;
	return `Age element at ${index}: ${age}`;

})
console.log(ages);
```

OUTPUT:
```javascript
(4) ["Age element at 0: 29", "Age element at 1: 54", "Age element at 2: 37", "Age element at 3: 82"]
```

* The biggest advantage of using arrow functions is unlike normal functions, arrow functions **don't** get their own ```this``` keyword. This means arrow functions do not have ```this``` keyword.They simply use the ```this``` keyword of the function they are written in. So we say they have *lexical* ```this``` keyword.

* Consider the following HTML file: 

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>ES6</title>
        <style>
            .box {
                width: 20px;
                padding: 6px;
                text-align: center;
                font-size: 3px;
                margin-top: 5px;
            }
            .green { background-color: green; }
            .blue { background-color: dodgerblue; }
            .orange { background-color: orangered; }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1></h1>
        <div class="box green">green!</div>
        <div class="box blue">blue!</div>
        <div class="box orange">orange!</div>
        <script src="arrow_functions_script.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

* And in the ```arrow_functions_script.js``` file we have following code: 

```javascript
var box = {
	color: 'green',
	position: 1,
	clickMe: function(){
		console.log(this);
		document.querySelector('.green').addEventListener('click', function(){
			var str = 'This is box number '+ this.position + ' and it is '+ this.color + ' in color';
			console.log(str);
		});
	}
}
box.clickMe();
```
OUTPUT:
```javascript
{color: "green", position: 1, clickMe: ƒ}
This is box number undefined and it is undefined in color.
```

* In the method ```clickMe```, ```this``` keyword points to  the object ```box``` which is how it should be. Because in a method call, the ```this``` keyword points to the calling object.

* But the Reason for second line of output is: Only in method call the ```this``` keyword points to the object. But in a regular function,the this keyword will always point to the global object. But I think, the ```this``` keyword in any callback of an event handler points to  the element that triggered the event, in this case the div with class 'green'. (When I do ```console.log(this)``` from inside the body of callback function, I get output: ```<div class="box green">green!</div>```).

* Anyway ```this``` keyword from inside the body of callback function is not pointing to the object ```box```. That is why, when we write ```this.position``` and ```this.color``` returns ```undefined``` from inside the callback function.

* One solution to the current problem could be to do something like this:

```javascript
var box = {
	color: 'green',
	position: 1,
	clickMe: function(){
		var context = this;
		document.querySelector('.green').addEventListener('click', function(){
			var str = 'This is box number '+ context.position + ' and it is '+ context.color + ' in color';
			console.log(str);
		});
	}
}

box.clickMe();
```
OUTPUT
```javascript
This is box number 1 and it is green in color.
```

* Let's now replace the callback function with ES6 arrow function:

```javascript
var box = {
	color: 'green',
	position: 1,
	clickMe: function(){
		console.log(this);
		document.querySelector('.green').addEventListener('click', ()=>{
		console.log(this);
		});
	}
}

box.clickMe();
```

OUTPUT
```javascript
{color: "green", position: 1, clickMe: ƒ}
ONCLICKING: {color: "green", position: 1, clickMe: ƒ}
```

* This approach with arrow functions works, because the callback function is an arrow function and it does not have its own definition of ```this``` keyword and now shares the *lexical* ```this``` of the surrounding function, which is the ```box``` object.

* So we can write like this:

```javascript
let box = {
	color: 'green',
	position: 1,
	clickMe: function(){
		document.querySelector('.green').addEventListener('click', ()=>{
			let str = `This is box number ${this.position} and it is ${this.color} in color.`;
			console.log(str);
		});
	}
}
box.clickMe();
```

OUTPUT
```javascript
This is box number 1 and it is green in color.
```

* Note that there is still a function which we can still replace with arrow function.Something like this:

```javascript
let box = {
	color: 'green',
	position: 1,
	clickMe: () => {
		console.log(this);
		document.querySelector('.green').addEventListener('click', ()=>{
			let str = `This is box number ${this.position} and it is ${this.color} in color.`;
			console.log(str);
		});
	},
}
box.clickMe();
```

OUTPUT
```javascript
Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}
ONCLICK: This is box number undefined and it is undefined in color.
```

* The reason for such response is , when we used arrow function for ```clickMe``` it now shares the lexical ```this``` keyword from its surroundings, which is the global context.

* So I need to be very careful with these arrow functions, so that I don't lose track of what the ```this``` keyword actually points to.

* Lets now look at another example of arrow function with a function constructor. ES5 first:

```javascript
function Person(name){
	this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.myFriends = function(friends){
	console.log(this);
	var arr = friends.map(function(el){
		console.log(this);
		return this.name + ' is friends with ' + el;
	});
	console.log(arr);
}

var friends = ['Bob', 'Jane', 'Mark'];
var john = new Person('John');
john.myFriends(friends);
```

OUTPUT

```javascript
Person {name: "John"}
Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}
Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}
Window {postMessage: ƒ, blur: ƒ, focus: ƒ, close: ƒ, parent: Window, …}
(3) [" is friends with Bob", " is friends with Jane", " is friends with Mark"]
```

*  So in the ```myFriends``` method, Because it is a property, it's ```this``` points to the calling object, which in this case is ```Person``` object. But inside this method, we are calling another function, which is the anonymous function passed to ```map```. Since its a function, the ```this``` keyword here does not point to the calling object but the global context ```Window```.

* This is where ```bind``` , ```call``` and ```apply``` methods will come in handy. They will allow us to bind the ```this``` with functions that have different context.

```javascript
function Person(name){
	this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.myFriends = function(friends){
	console.log(this);
	var arr = friends.map(function(el){
		console.log(this);
		return this.name + ' is friends with ' + el;
	}.bind(this));
	console.log(arr);
}

var friends = ['Bob', 'Jane', 'Mark'];
var john = new Person('John');
john.myFriends(friends);
```

OUTPUT
```javascript
Person {name: "John"}
Person {name: "John"}
Person {name: "John"}
Person {name: "John"}
(3) ["John is friends with Bob", "John is friends with Jane", "John is friends with Mark"]
```
* ES6 equivalent:
```javascript
function Person(name){
	this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.myFriends = function(friends){
	console.log(this);
	var arr = friends.map(el =>{
		console.log(this);
		return this.name + ' is friends with ' + el;
	});
	console.log(arr);
}

var friends = ['Bob', 'Jane', 'Mark'];
var john = new Person('John');
john.myFriends(friends);
```

OUTPUT
```javascript
Person {name: "John"}
Person {name: "John"}
Person {name: "John"}
Person {name: "John"}
(3) ["John is friends with Bob", "John is friends with Jane", "John is friends with Mark"]
```

* To make it look more concise:

```javascript
function Person(name){
	this.name = name;
}
Person.prototype.myFriends = function(friends){
	console.log(this);
	var arr = friends.map(el => `${this.name} is friends with ${el}`);
	console.log(arr);
}

var friends = ['Bob', 'Jane', 'Mark'];
var john = new Person('John');
john.myFriends(friends);
```

OUTPUT:
```
Person {name: "John"}
(3) ["John is friends with Bob", "John is friends with Jane", "John is friends with Mark"]
```
##

### Destructuring

* Destructuring is a very convenient way to extract data from a data structure like an object or an array.
* Consider a following array:

```javascript
var john = ['John', 26];
```
*  Suppose we wanted to store each of the element in a seperate variable, we would simply have to write one variable for each element like this:

```javascript
var name =john[0];
var age = john[1];
```
* If we had many more elements in that array, extracting them and storing them in a seperate variable would become impractical. So in ES6 we have something called **Destructuring** for such problems:

```javascript
const [name, year] = ['john', 26];
```

* What this is going to do is it is going to create a ```const``` called ```name``` and ```const``` called ```year``` and then the data will be stored in each of these variables.

```javascript
console.log(name);
console.log(year);
```
OUTPUT:
```javascript
john
26
```
* This works well with objects too, all we need to ensure is that the keys match is exactly same way:

```javascript
const obj = {
	firstName: 'John',
	lastName: 'Smith',
}

const {lastName, firstName} = obj;
console.log(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);

```
OUTPUT:
```javascript
John Smith
```
* If we don't want the variable names to match with the key names , then we can use different names:

```javascript
const obj = {
	firstName: 'John',
	lastName: 'Smith',
}

const{ firstName: a, lastName: b} = obj;
console.log(`${a} ${b}`);

```

OUTPUT:
```javascript
John Smith
```

* Lets look at a more practical way of destructuring.

```javascript
function calcAgeRetirement(year){
	const age = new Date().getFullYear()-year;
	return [age, 65-age];
}

const [age, retirement] = calcAgeRetirement(1990);
console.log(age);
console.log(retirement);

```

//OUTPUT:
```javascript
29
36
```
* For objects: 
```javascript
function calcAgeRetirement(year){
	const age = new Date().getFullYear() - year;
	return {
		age: age,
		ageUntilRetirement: 65-age,
	};
}

const {ageUntilRetirement} = calcAgeRetirement(1990);
console.log(ageUntilRetirement);
```

OUTPUT:
```javascript
36
```
## 

### Arrays
* Consider the HTML file again:
```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>ES6</title>
        <style>
            .box {
                width: 200px;
                padding: 60px;
                text-align: center;
                font-size: 20px;
                margin-top: 50px;
            }
            .green { background-color: green; }
            .blue { background-color: dodgerblue; }
            .orange { background-color: orangered; }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1></h1>
        <div class="box green">green!</div>
        <div class="box blue">blue!</div>
        <div class="box orange">orange!</div>
        <script src="arrays_script.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
* In our script, lets select all the boxes:

```javascript
const boxes = document.querySelectorAll('.box');
```

* ```boxes``` is a ```NodeList``` and not an array. In ES6 we can convert it to an array using **```Array.from()```**, and then we can change the color of all boxes to blue:

```javascript
const boxesArray =  Array.from(boxes);
boxesArray.forEach(cur => cur.style.backgroundColor = 'dodgerblue');
```

* Usually when we we want to loop through the entire array we could use either ```forEach``` or ```map``` methods. But these methods do not allow use of ```break``` and ```continue``` statements.

* So suppose for all the boxes with classes which are not ```blue``` we want to change their text, and we want to use a ```continue``` statement.

* ```continue``` will simply skip the current iteration of the loop and go right to the next one, and ```break``` keyword will break the loop and it would stop here and not continue to the next iteration.

* So in cases like these, where we want to use ```break``` or ```continue``` method on loop, we can not use ```forEach``` and ```map```. Then we would have to write something like this in ES5:

```javascript
for(var i = 0; i<boxesArray.length; i++){
	if(boxesArray[i].className === 'box blue'){
		continue;
	}
	boxesArray[i].textContent = 'I changed to blue';
}
```

* This forces us to use a lot of code for a very simple loop. Now in ES6 we now have a new loop **```for...of```** which combines the benefits of ```for``` and ```forEach``` loops. It allows us to use keywords ```break``` and ```continue```.

SYNTAX:
```javascript
for (variable of iterable) {
  statement
}
```

USAGE: 
```javascript
for(let cur of boxesArray){
	if(cur.className === 'box blue')
		continue;
	cur.textContent = 'I changed to BLUE';
}
```
